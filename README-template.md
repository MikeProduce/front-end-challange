## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://front-end-challange-gb4k.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

I used mobile first development and eventually went to bigger screen sizes. The navigation bar needs some more work as it did not want to work on certain phones.
I could probably break up the code a little bit more into smaller chunks.
